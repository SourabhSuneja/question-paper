What is NLP?JSONParams:{"qType":"Short Answer Type","weightage":1,"ansExplanation":"NLP stands for Natural Language Processing. It is the process of making computers understand human languages.","mediaEmbedded":"none","mediaLink":"","startTime":0,"endTime":0,"card":10}
Differentiate between stemming and lemmatisation.JSONParams:{"qType":"Short Answer Type","weightage":1,"ansExplanation":"Stemming simplifies a word by removing any affixes. For example, the words \"playing\" and \"played\" are changed to just \"play\".<br>Whereas, lemmatisation reduces a word to its proper base form while still keeping it accurate. For example, \"sang\" and \"sung\" are changed to \"sing\".","mediaEmbedded":"none","mediaLink":"","startTime":0,"endTime":0,"card":50}
